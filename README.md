- 👋 Hi, I’m Jiapeng Zhou, a second year postgraduate at ICT, CAS(@2022.9). Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree at HUST.
- 👀 I’m interested in compiler, OS, micro architecture, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on resource scheduling in DC. Previously, I focused on optimizations for cache(e.g., prefetch, replacement policy).
